      Tags the current checkout and pushes tag to remote.
      
      Normally will tag and deploy whatever is in your current git working
      copy -- you may want to use with the guard tasks to make sure
      you're deploying what you think and sync'ing it to your upstream
      repository:
      
        before "deploy", "git:guard_committed", "git:guard_upstream", "git:tag"
        
      However, if you have set cap :branch, git:retag will tag the HEAD
      of THAT branch, rather than whatever is the current working copy
      branch. 
      
      Either way, git:tag:
      * pushes the new tag to upstream remote git
      * sets the cap :branch variable to the newly created tag, to be 
        sure cap deploys that tag. 
      
      What will the created tag look like?
      
      Without multi-stage, by default something like `deploy-yyyy-mm-dd-hhmm`. 
      
      * The deploy- prefix will be the current stage name if multi-stage.
      * The prefix can be manually set in config file or command line
        with cap :tag_prefix variable instead.
      * Somewhat experimental, you can also set :tag_template to change the
        part after the prefix.
      * or you can specify a complete tag on the cap command line `-s tag=deploy-whatever`.  
      
      `set :confirm_tag, true` in the config file to force an interactive
      prompt and confirmation before continuing.

      Takes an already existing tag, and retags it and deploys that tag.
    
        Will push the new tag to upstream repo, and set the new tag as cap 
        :branch so cap willd deploy it.  
    
        Usually used in git multistage for moving from staging to production, 
        for instance in your production.rb:
        
          before "deploy", "git:retag" 
        
        Or use with the guard tasks:
          before "deploy", "git:guard_committed", "git:guard_upstream", "git:retag"
        
        `set :confirm_tag, true` in the config file to force an interactive
        prompt and confirmation before continuing. 
        
        What tag will be used as source tag?
        
        * Normally the most recent tag beginning "staging-"
        * Or set cap :tag_prefix in config file or command line
          to use a different prefix.
        * Or set :tag_from in config file or on command line
          to specify a specific tag. `cap deploy -s tag_from=staging_something`
          
        What will the newly created tag look like? Same rules as for
        git:tag. 
        
        * By default in a production stage it's going to look 
        like `production-yyyy-mm-dd-hhmm`, but there are several
        of cap variables you can set in a config file to change this,
        including :tag_prefix and :tag_template

      Looks for tags matching the prefix that the tag or retag task
      would use to tag. Ie, 'deploy-', or 'stagename-' in multi-stage,
      or according to :tag_prefix setting. 
     
      Will also output date of tag, commit message, and account doing the commit.

     Show log between most tagged deploy and what would be deployed now.                
     
     Requires you to be using git:tag or git:retag to make any sense,
     so we can find the 'last deployed' tag to compare. 
     
     You can run this manually:
         cap git:commit_log
     Or for multi-stage, perhaps:
         cap staging git:commit_log
         cap production git:commit_log
     Or you can use cap callbacks to ensure this is shown before
     a deploy, for multi-stage for instance add to your production.rb:
        before "git:retag", "git:commit_log"
        # and force an interactive confirmation after they've seen it
        set :confirm_retag, true     
     
     Ordinarily shows commit log between current git working copy
     (forced to current head of :branch if cap :branch is set), and
     last deployed tag, by default tag beginning "deploy-", or
     tag beginning :stage if you are cap multi-stage, or beginning
     with :tag_prefix if that is set. 
          
     Hard-coded to do something special if you are using multistage
     cap, and are in stage 'production' -- in that case it will
     show you the commits between the most recent production-* tag,
     and the most recent staging-* tag. (Cap :tag_prefix and :from_prefix
     can change those tag prefixes).
